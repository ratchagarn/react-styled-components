# React Styled Components

My react playground for styled-components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

##### `yarn start`
Starts the development server.

##### `yarn build`
Bundles the app into static files for production.

##### `yarn test`
Starts the test runner.

##### `yarn eject`
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
